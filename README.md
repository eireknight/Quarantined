# Quarantined
Second project for the UCF Coding Bootcamp 2020
https://eireknight.github.io/Quarantined/

While stuck at home during the Quarantine, this application can be used to cook for yourself and craft drinks during this difficult time.  Use the ingredients you already
have in your home to search for recipes you can make!  Included forums for discussion of favorite recipes and alternative ways of making them.
